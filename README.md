## Introduction
### Theoretical Framework
Educational researcher and developer have long seen the potential of digital game for creating a learning experiences that encourage students to learning a subject with enthusiasm like when they learn how to play a commercial digital game. However, for the knowledge that students received from the digital game to be converted into a real world knowldege, they need a skillful interpreter that translate what they get from game to real world knowledge. These "translation process" enable teacher to take advantage the implicit learning that happens when player engage with rules and  challenge inside the game so students to have explicit understanding about what they learn.

Analogy are a common strategy for develop new knowledge in learning science. By using analogy can help students can creating new knowledge by using their prior knowledge. Analogy can effectively help student understand concept that hard to grasp by connecting concept they understand to subject they currently learn in the classroom.

Digital games is a powerful source of analogies, because they can be designed systematically according to subject the students currently learn. By using digital games in classroom and the whole class play before instruction, ensure the class have same knowledge and undestanding from the same analogy source to be used to build a new knowledge.

Researchers have identified the specific ways to allow teacher use analogy for effective teaching method. The connection from the source and target must not limited to only surface level similarities, rather they must also show similarities on relationship,structures or processess.

In this study, a pedagogical approach called analogy mapping are explored. The use of digital games can be particulary useful in this process called analogy mapping because digital games contain lot of image and action that will be remembered and maybe discussed by teacher and students after the gameplay over.

### Research Question
Do students who play digital science games and then engage in discussions that map analogies from the games to the concepts they address demonstrate greater understanding of those concepts than students who play the games but do not engage in those discussions?

## Methods


## Findings


## Discussion
Researcher who studied the use of digital games for educational have found that game can be a effective tool for support students learning.
But researcher who focus on the use of digital games in real world have observed that teacher need strategies to fully use the benefit of using game as tool for support students learning. Although indeed games can provide enganging experience, positive learning comes rely from good instructions and good instructions come from how much the teacher understand the game.

Though many studies focuses more on game design when designing digital games for education, studies that looked on teacher's practice found that student have positive outcomes when teacher use "bridging activities", in which teacher have discussion about the game and have deep understanding about the digital game they use.

Similarly this study also found that students whose teacher use bridging activities while playing digital game show more positive outcomes compared to the students play the similar digital game but the teacher did not do bridging activities. The finding from this study suggest that using instructional techniques holds promise as an approach to integrating digital games into instructions.

The limitations of this study is particulary the small sample size, self-selection into the study and lack of randomized assignemnt prevent them from making any causal claims about the techniques.
